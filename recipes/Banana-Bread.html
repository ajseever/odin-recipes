    <h2>Banana bread is a quickbread, meaning that it relies on chemical leveners to make it rise, as opposed to tradional yeast breads. Banana bread is commonly served in a loaf form, but could easily be made into muffins as muffins are also quickbreads. Banana bread is a soft, moist bread with a sweet flavor. It's commonly flavored by brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and the titular ingredient, bananas. Frozen bananas are commonly used due to their longer lifespan and ability to maintain peak ripeness.</h2>
