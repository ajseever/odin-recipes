    <h1>Court Bullion</h1>
    <img src="../RecipeImage/court-bullion.jpg">
    <h2>Court Bullion is a flavorful broth commonly used for poaching seafood such as fish or shrimp. The gentle cooking method of poaching is used since seafood is commonly a delicate ingredient to work with. The broth has a sharp and fresh flavor due to the wine, lemon and fresh vegetables. Unlike other broths, court bullion has a relatively short cooking time making it a feasible weeknight option. Poaching in court bullion lends a sharp flavor while keeping your dish moist and tender. Court bullion translates from French to "briefly boiled broth". There are many variations on the recipe, but they all contain a base liquid, an acid, aromatics and vegetables.</h2>
